##### James Edwards, December 2016

My personal website, which can be found at http://www.jedwards.me. The domain was provided by [NameCheap](https://nc.me) and the site is hosted through Github pages.

Icons used on the page were downloaded from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io). The rest of the site was created with HTML and CSS, as well as one simple section of Javascript.

Enjoy!


<!-- TODO:
  1. Split CSS into various files
  2. Incorporate SASS
  3. Think of more fun things to do with javascript
  4. Resizing works for small windows but maybe not mobile?
  5. Update colors at some point - or set up automatic changing? -->
