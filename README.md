##### James Edwards, December 2016

My personal website, which can be found at http://www.jedwards.me. The domain was provided by [NameCheap](https://nc.me) and the site is hosted through Github pages.

Icons used on the page were downloaded from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io). The rest of the site was created with HTML and CSS, as well as one simple section of Javascript.

Enjoy!
